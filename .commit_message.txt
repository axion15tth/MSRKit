feat: Complete HTDemucs-CUNet implementation with degradation profiles

Major Features:
- HTDemucs-lite + Complex U-Net two-stage architecture (114M params)
- Degradation estimator with 11 acoustic features
- On-the-fly degradation profiles (DT1/2/3) for training
- GAN training with multiple discriminators
- Multi-dataset support (MUSDB18, MoisesDB, RawStems)

Core Components:
- Stage 1: HTDemucs-lite (28M params)
- Stage 2: Complex U-Net Restorer (86M params)
- Degradation Estimator (141K params)

Loss Functions:
- SI-SNR, L1 waveform, Multi-Resolution STFT
- Complex Loss, Mixture Reconstruct Loss
- CLAP/FAD proxy losses (optional)
- GAN + Feature Matching losses

Tools:
- setup_datasets.sh: One-command dataset setup
- Data preparation scripts for MUSDB18/MoisesDB
- Degradation profiles with FFmpeg codec support
- Inference script

Documentation:
- Comprehensive README with quickstart
- QUICKSTART.md for server deployment
